That was my first website. It took a few days to build it. Because there were some complicated parts

which I wasn't able to fix quickly. But I managed to set it. First of all, I divided my project to

3 sections. The first section is "Home Page", the Second is "About Me", and the third is "Contacts". All of them

contain CSSâ€”details in the project file.
